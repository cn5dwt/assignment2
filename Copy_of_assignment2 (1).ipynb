        "1. This paper is about data tidying which is an important part of data cleaning. Data tidying is important because it is easy to tidy messy data. This paper dives into the application of data tidying, its structure, and tidy tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The tidy data standard is intended to facilitate initial exploration and reanalysis of the data, and to simplify the development of data analysis tools that work well together.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The first sentence means that tidy datasets are all similar in the way that it offers a standardized wat to link the structure and thus share commonalities. Messy datasets are all unique in the way that they all have different complications to work through to tidy them, or not all messy datasets are messy in the same way. The second sentence explains that by looking at datasets, it is easy to define figure out which are variables since they are organized by columns and what are observations since they are organized by rows. However, it is difficult to precisely define these observations and variables because these can linked together, making it difficult to define and separate. Wickham uses the example of height and width which could be considered as values of a dimension variable.\n",

        "5. Tidy data is defined as a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset into its structure. There are three requirements for tidy data, (1) Each variable forms a column, (2) each observation forms a row, and (3) each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. The 5 most common problems with messy datasets are:\n",
        "  1.  Column headers are values, not variable names.\n",
        "  2. Multiple variables are stored in one column.\n",

        "  4. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.\n",
        "  5. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "  The data in table 4 are messy because columns need to be converted into rows and headers need to be created. For example, the values for income are a row instead of a column and the frequency values need be organized into one column. This problem can be fixed by \"melting\" the dataset, by turning the columns into rows.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Table 11 is messy because there is a column for each day thus not having variables as columns and observations as rows. There is also a lot of missing data. Table 12a is molten because the days columns in table 11 have been reduced to 1 date column which put changes the days of the month columns into rows. Table 12b is tidy because the element column has been split into 2 columns: tmax and tmin.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. The chicken-and-egg problem with focusing on tidy data is considering if tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it, then tidy tools will be inextricably linked to tidy data. Wickham hopes that future analysts will continue to build upon the tidy data framework and develop even better data storage strategies and better tools."
